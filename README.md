# Galois energy games

This repository contains the formalised results of my master's thesis, titled "**A Formal Proof of Decidability of Multi-weighted Declining Energy Games**" written at the **Technical University of Berlin**. 

## Structure of the Repository

- **`/isabelle-theories`**: This folder contains the Isabelle theories, which are the formalisations of some of the results in my thesis. These theories have been further developed since the original submission.
  
- **`/submitted-documents`**: This folder contains the documents built from the Isabelle theories originally submitted and present the formal proofs. These files correspond to the version of the formalisation the master's thesis references.

## Overview

Building on Benjamin Bisping's research, we study (multi-weighted) energy games with reachability winning conditions. These are zero-sum two-player games with perfect information played on directed graphs labelled by (multi-weighted) energy functions. Bisping introduced a generalisation of the bisimulation game to decide all common notions of behavioural equivalence at once. While he claims decidability and provides an algorithm to compute minimal attacker winning budgets (i.e. Pareto fronts), the claim lacks a formal proof. Using Isabelle/HOL, we provide a machine-checked proof to substantiate Bispingâ€™s claim of decidability.

This master's thesis provides an overview of the formalised results and contextualises them within the research. Furthermore, we abstract the necessary properties used in the proof and introduce new classes of energy games, named (generalised) Galois energy games. Simplifying and generalising Bisping's algorithm we prove the decidability of these classes, assuming that the set of positions is finite and the energies form a well-founded bounded join-semilattice.

Despite the original title of the master's thesis ("A Formal Proof of Decidability of Multi-weighted Declining Energy Games") we study energy games with reachability winning conditions extensively. In particular, we are able to show decidability for energy games that are not declining, concluding that monotonicity plays the key role. However, declining energy games result in significantly better running times, which in some fixed-dimension cases are polynomial. By providing new decidability results, this work strengthens the theoretical foundations of multi-weighted energy games.

### Important Note: Theories are Evolving 

Since the submission of my thesis, the Isabelle formalization has undergone further development. This means that the Isabelle theories in this repository may have evolved and expanded beyond what was presented in the thesis.
